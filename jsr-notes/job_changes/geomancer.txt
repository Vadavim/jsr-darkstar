[Elemental Runes]
 - Gains access to the Rune Fencer's elemental runes. 
 - These runes are on different recast timers.
 - Has the same limits on how many runes may be harboured based on Geomancer level.

[No more pets!]
They're gone! Instead, all Geo/Indi spells are centered on you.
The Geo spells are buffs centered on you.
The Indi spells are instead debuffs centered on you. They apply the penalty associated with the stat they would normally buff.

[Required Runes]
To cast Indi/Geo spells, and -ra spells, you need to harbour at least one rune of the associated element.
For each additional rune you harbour of the associated element, 15% of the mana cost is refunded.
Because of this, some Geo spells that inflict penalties to creatures have been removed.

The casting time of the Indi/Geo spells has been reduced.

You are not limited by the number of Indi/Geo spells you can maintain. Instead,
each of these spells has a very long recast time (30 minutes).

When you cast an elemental nuke, there is a chance you will reset indi/geo spells of the associated element.
The chance depends upon the MP cost of the spell and your level.

 - Instead doubles the duration of your next Indi/Geo spell.
